### App Idea Evaluation
- Mobile: This app is necessary for mobile because it utilizes quick access to music through Apple music and
          it allows users to edit the group queue in real time while socializing.
- Story:  This app solves a problem that many people have suffered through. The value of this app is very clear
          when thinking about how many times a friend has queued up a bad song or when hosting an event, how
          many times people give song requests. Our friends would respond very positively to this idea because
          they have encountered the aforementioned problem numberous times.
- Market: The market for this app is very large as the target audience is anyone who listens to music with other
          people. This applies to many people and they will all have at least some interest in checking out this
          product.
- Habit:  This app is very habit forming considering it would be used anytime someone is listening to music around
          others and wants them to be apart of the song choices. The user consumes the app by utilizing its features
          to make their lives easier with song requests. However, it also allows the user to create as they can build
          their own queues with others.
- Scope:  The scope of this app is feasible to complete in the time allotted because the required features to make the
          app function are very small while additional optional features are plentiful.
